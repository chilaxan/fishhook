'''
This module allows for swapping out the slot pointers contained in static
classes with the `generic` slot pointers used by python for heap classes.
This allows for assigning arbitrary python functions to static class dunders
using `hook` and `hook_cls` and for applying new functionality to previously
unused dunders. A hooked static dunder can be restored to original
functionality using the `unhook` function
